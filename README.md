# Read Me Your README

## Purpose
For this project, I wanted to create a README.md generator for other developers to easily produce READMEs for all their coding projects. A user simply has to install Node.js. The user will be prompted with questions about their README from the command line. After all questions are answered, a README.md is generated for the developer's use.

## Built With
*JavaScript
*Node.js
*Inquirer
